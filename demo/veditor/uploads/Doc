The data are organized by Chassis, Slots, Items
Chassis is a structure which contains Slots.
Slots is where we will attach Items.
Items is a containers of item that can be attached to Slots, it's like a category of model compatible for the slot Items will be attached

A Slots can have more than one Items, typically it's used to say. On the Slot Wheel you can attach Items Wheel30" and Wheel31"
Here an example:
Item Wheel30" contains 4 differents type of Wheel:
Wheel0
Wheel1
Wheel2
Wheel3

Item Wheel31" contains 2 differents type of Wheel:
SuperWheel
ShinyWheel

So now imagine the Slot Wheel has attached Wheel30" and Wheel31" then we can attach Wheel0, Wheel1, Wheel2, Wheel3, SuperWheel, ShinyWheel to the Slot Wheel.
As another example if we have another Slot WheelBack that only has Wheel31" attached, then we will only be able to attach SuperWheel and ShinyWheel.

In Blender to setup this behaviour we organised data like below:
Chassis is hierarchy the root must be named Chassisxxxxx, that can be a model composed by empties or not
Slot is an Empty that must be named Slotxxxxx its name must start with "Slot"
Items is a group named Itemxxxxx, it must start by "Item". To add Items to Slot you just need to instanciate a Group and add it as child of the slot you want.


Export Process
In the export process, all slots are checked and all group as child will be referenced to be plugable to the Slot.
