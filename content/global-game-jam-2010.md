We participated in the global game jam 2010. The idea was to create an
entire (small) game in 48 hours with a given theme. This year the theme
was 'seduction and deception'. Our game was called
PrincessKunKunPechoPecho and was created with the blender game engine so
that we could experiment a bit with it. We should have spent some time
learning about it before because we spent too much of our precious
little 48 hours learning about it during the session.. Anyway here is
the result :)
