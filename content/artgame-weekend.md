A Month ago, we have participated to the [artgame
weekend](http://artgameweekend.com/) . The idea is to make a game in 48h
on a mobile platform. I joined Chen to work on her concept, the idea was
to use a guitar hero gameplay on an Hitler speech. The concept is strong
and make people feel uncomfortable with the game.
I have made the choice to work on android because I have a HTC hero and
it's more open than Iphone. When I started I had just installed eclipse
on my ubuntu box and tried the hello world example. I am a novice on
mobile platform. 48h later I am really impressed by this experience.
The workflow to test and develop android apps with eclipse was
impressive. It just worked as expected. usually I am an emacs users, but
for this experience I have used the 'regular' path as explained on the
android sdk.

At the end we had a game, but we worked more after the weekend to
release it. Because of the sensible subject the game is, we had to
adjust/change some part.
