I did a talk at webgl camp in switzerland, that was really nice to meet
other people doing webgl stuff. Amazing projects seen there like quake4
in the browser, the nokia demo, really interesting projects. I talked
about how shaders were generated in sketchfab.com and you can find my
slides [here](demo/webglcamp-shader-generation)

For the list of all talk have look on the
[website](http://www.shader.org/webglcamp/)

Hope to meet webgl campers again in a session in europe.
