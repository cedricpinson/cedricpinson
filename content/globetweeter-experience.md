Slug: globetweeter-experience

Over the last few months, I have been working on a webgl demo for
firefox. The objective was to create a demo to showcase webgl
technology. I am currently working on a 3D framework called
[osgjs](http://osgjs.org) so the application uses this javascript
library. osgjs is a javascript implementation of
[OpenSceneGraph](http://openscenegraph.org) and helps to manage 3d
scenes and webgl states. You can get more information on the
[website](http://osgjs.org).

We did different experiments before we ended up with globetweeter, I
kept some of them for history :)

### Jurassic Park

I started off by creating a file system similar to the 3D file system
used in Jurassic Park. I had to figure out the best type of camera that
would be suitable to use with the system.

-   ![](media/2011/03/camera-1.jpg "Camera")
-   ![](media/2011/03/camera-0.jpg "Camera")

The idea is simple. Let's say a user selects the item **B** . When
selected, the camera moves from its current viewpoint to the chosen
item. The position of the camera (**C**) is in orbit relative to the
selected item. Basically I used a lookat matrix from the camera position
(**C**) to the target item. To create the camera motion when moving from
one item to another, I interpolated the target position (**from A to
B**) and generated a rotation around this interpolated point (**X**)
during the animation. I added some constraints like the distance from
the target point and some limits in the rotation to keep the camera
position in range (like if we would see the item from a 3rd person).
Check out this [experiment](demo/ff4demo/demo3/demo.html)
(use 'del' key to go to previous level).

### Twitter

This idea ended up being too geeky, so we tried out something more
popular and surrounded by more hype. And therein was born the idea of
displaying tweets with 3D.
A first try was to iterate on something like tweet deck but we wanted
something that would be more responsive and with eye candy features...
the first ugly [experiment](demo/ff4demo/demo2/demo.html)
was to render tweets in a canvas and to use them as texture in 3D. We
ended up dropping this idea and instead decided to show tweets
geo-localized on the earth.

The last idea we had is the current incarnation of the globe tweeter. To
make the globe I used 3 data files from [natural earth
data](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/)

-   [110m admin 0
    countries.shp](http://showwebgl.com/show/?q=g6lu4j6t5m8scg4s8og0wkwwss0gwk0&LIGHT=0&CULL_FACE=0)
    contains the polygons of countries
-   [110m
    coastline.shp](http://showwebgl.com/show/?q=6f68hn2hr8so44csowwc4skkcgg4s8k&LIGHT=0)
    contains only the coastline (meaning lines around oceans)
-   [110m admin 0 boundary lines
    land.shp](http://showwebgl.com/show/?q=fxaeg6xeuvc4so0sgcgkswsgk0sw8g4&LIGHT=0)
    contains the lines inside land boundaries

As you can see, those data are flat and need to be projected on a
sphere. Before projecting those data, however, I had to tesselate the
triangles in order to have enough vertex to project a clean shape on the
sphere. For this I have created a tool called 'grid'. It tessellates the
input shape with a grid. It's a kind of boolean union operation.

-   ![](media/2011/03/grid.jpg "grid")
-   ![](media/2011/03/grid0.jpg "grid0")

Above on the left, you can see the white model that is the original
'110m admin 0 countries.shp'. The black model is the same model but
tesselated a bit more to fit more closely on the sphere. On the right is
the model (grid) use to tessellate the original '110m admin 0
countries.shp'. The idea is to add subdivisions on the height section of
the model.

Once the data is subdivided enough, I created a tool to project each
vertex onto a sphere using the standard [WGS84
projection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGS84). **You can see a webgl
version of the projected model by clicking on the picture**.

-   ![](media/2011/03/globe-2.jpg "globe-2")
-   ![](media/2011/03/globe-1.jpg "globe-1")
-   ![](media/2011/03/globe-0.jpg "globe-0")
-   ![](media/2011/03/globe-4.jpg "globe-4")

Once the data below were ready we selected a nice color for each model.
On the demo I drew the globe in two passes. The first pass drew back
faces of '110m admin 0 countries' with 'back color' and the second drew
the front faces with 'front color'. It was necessary to have
transparency of the globe because of the blending mode 'One Minus Src
Alpha'.

The Final result looks like this

### Wave

To add some details about twitter activity I setup a simple wave physics
simulation that produces waves where tweets appear. The algorithm to
produce the waves is explained
[here](http://freespace.virgin.net/hugo.elias/graphics/x_water.htm). To
accomplish this I used two small hidden canvases with a size of 128x64 ,
I used small canvases because the computation is done on javascsipt and
can be expensive. The update of waves was updated every 1/30 seconds.
The update function did the following operations:

-   Convert tweets locations into source wave in the canvas.
-   Do the physics computation and store the result into the current
    canvas.
-   Upload the current canvas as texture to use in the vertex shader.
    The vertex shader used this texture as a
    [heightmap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heightmap). To understand
    better how the heightmap works you can see
    [here](http://showwebgl.com/show/?q=7m1vu1clptog8ccs880o0s44cwks000&LIGHT=0)
    the original model without waves.

Vertex Shader

    :::GLShaderLexer
    #ifdef GL_ES
    precision highp float;
    #endif
    attribute vec3 Vertex;
    attribute vec3 TexCoord0;
    uniform mat4 ModelViewMatrix;
    uniform mat4 ProjectionMatrix;
    uniform mat4 NormalMatrix;
    uniform float scale;
    uniform sampler2D Texture0;
    varying float height;
    float maxHeight = 1400000.0;
    void main(void) {
        vec4 color = texture2D( Texture0, TexCoord0.xy);
        height = color[0];
        vec3 normal = normalize(Vertex);
        vec3 normalTransformed = vec3(NormalMatrix * vec4(normal,0.0));
        float dotComputed = dot(normalTransformed, vec3(0,0,1));
        height *= max(0.0, dotComputed);
        vec4 vrt = vec4(Vertex +  normal * ( height * maxHeight * scale),1.0);
        gl_Position = ProjectionMatrix * ModelViewMatrix * vrt;
        height *= 5.0 * scale;
    }

Fragment Shader

    :::GLShaderLexer
    #ifdef GL_ES
    precision highp float;
    #endif
    uniform vec4 fragColor;
    varying float height;
    void main(void) {
        gl_FragColor = fragColor * height;
    }

This shader is applied on a regular grid model projected on the sphere
as explained before but this time the grid has a better resolution. Some
of you will not see the relief of the waves because some webgl
implementation does not expose texture unit on the vertex shader.
Therefore as a work around I made another shader that does not move the
vertexes in the vertex shader. Instead it only changes the color of the
vertexes. You can read more about this issue on the [Angle
project](https://groups.google.com/group/angleproject/browse_thread/thread/fbf08f0ab51ff26d).

Vertex Shader

    :::GLShaderLexer
    #ifdef GL_ES
    precision highp float;
    #endif
    attribute vec3 Vertex;
    attribute vec3 TexCoord0;
    uniform mat4 ModelViewMatrix;
    uniform mat4 ProjectionMatrix;
    uniform mat4 NormalMatrix;
    varying float dotComputed;
    varying vec2 TexCoordFragment;
    void main(void) {
        TexCoordFragment = TexCoord0.xy;
        vec3 normal = normalize(Vertex);
        vec3 normalTransformed = vec3(NormalMatrix * vec4(normal,0.0));
        dotComputed = max(0.0, dot(normalTransformed, vec3(0,0,1)));
        if (dotComputed > 0.001) {
            dotComputed = 1.0;
        }
        gl_Position = ProjectionMatrix * ModelViewMatrix * vec4(Vertex, 1);
    }

Fragment Shader

    :::GLShaderLexer
    #ifdef GL_ES
    precision highp float;
    #endif
    uniform sampler2D Texture0;
    uniform vec4 fragColor;
    uniform float scale;
    varying float dotComputed;
    varying vec2 TexCoordFragment;
    void main(void) {
        vec4 color = texture2D( Texture0, TexCoordFragment.xy);
        gl_FragColor = fragColor * min(2.0*dotComputed * color.x, 0.999999);
    }

Yes it's a bit sad, I have seen this issue lately ... :( . As conclusion
this effect works well but it takes too much cpu in javascript/canvas, I
should have tried a different effect that was less cpu intensive. Have a
look at this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul9cIj7wISE) if you
can't see the waves's relief.

### Tweets

Tweets are displayed with the avatar image with simple quad oriented and
positioned on the sphere from latitude/longitude. To add a nice border
around the image I used a blending operation in the canvas with the
following image.

![](media/2011/04/tweets.jpg "tweets")

Finally to have a nice animation when a tweet appears and disappears, I
used an EaseInQuad function for the color, and EaseOutElastic for the
scale component.

    :::JavascriptLexer
    EaseInQuad = function(t) { return (t*t); };
    EaseOutElastic = function(t) { return Math.pow(2.0, -10.0*t) *
                                             Math.sin((t-0.3/4.0) *
                                             (2.0*Math.PI) / 0.3) + 1.0; };

Zooming to the earth made tweet really huge related to the screen. To
prevent this effect I introduced a scale factor that depends on the
camera altitude. The full code to update a tweet looks like this

    :::JavascriptLexer
    update: function(node, nv) {
        var ratio = 0;
        var currentTime = nv.getFrameStamp().getSimulationTime();
        if (node.startTime === undefined) {
            node.startTime = currentTime;
            if (node.duration === undefined) {
                node.duration = 5.0;
            }
        }

        var dt = currentTime - node.startTime;
        if (dt > node.duration) {
            node.setNodeMask(0);
            return;
        }
        ratio = dt/node.duration;
        if (node.originalMatrix) {
            var scale;
            if (dt > 1.0) {
                scale = 1.0;
            } else {
                scale = osgAnimation.EaseOutElastic(dt);
            }

            scale *= (this.manipulator.height/this.WGS_84_RADIUS_EQUATOR);
            if (this.manipulator.height > this.limit) {
               var limitConst = 0.8/(2.5*this.WGS_84_RADIUS_EQUATOR-this.limit);
               var rr = 1.0 - (this.manipulator.height-this.limit) * limitConst;
               scale *= rr;
            }
            var scaleMatrix = osg.Matrix.makeScale(scale, scale, scale);
            node.setMatrix(osg.Matrix.mult(node.originalMatrix, scaleMatrix));
        }

        var value = (1.0 - osgAnimation.EaseInQuad(ratio));
        var uniform = node.uniform;
        var c = [value, value, value, value];
        uniform.set(c);
        node.traverse(nv);
    }



### NodeJS

The server responsible for sending tweets to the clients is done with
nodejs. I used twitter-node, socket.io, and express modules to build the
server. The code is really short so you can have a look on the server
directly. You can get the server code
[here](https://github.com/cedricpinson/globetweeter-server/) and improve
it :) A big hug to proppy who bootstraps the nodejs server \\o/

### Stats

The first graph shows the number of connections per day. There is a big
spike when the news was broadcasted. The second graph shows the number
of connections per day but with a smaller scale and the last graph shows
the cumulated number of connections.
