I am currently experimenting WebGL. I work with OpenSceneGraph and
wanted to try something equivalent in javascript. Even though javscript
is slower than C++ i wanted to try a proof of concept with WebGL and
create a library similar to OpenSceneGraph. After experimenting a bit, i
am convinced that a minimal OpenSceneGraph implementation would makes
sense for developer to create new 3d applications on the web. I will
continue in this direction and add features step by step... I did not
implement reader of obj, collada or other files types, instead i created
a json writer plugin for OpenSceneGraph then i am able to convert all
input format that OSG is able to read and convert them into json. The
idea is setup a webservice that will convert input files and return json
files to use in javascript.
The current demo uses few features, there is multitexturing (no dynamic
lighting yet). I tried to implement the shader compositor like Roland
submitted into OpenSceneGraph. My implementation is quick and dirty, so
a lot of improvement will come soon.

To get a WebGL Implementation have look to Khronos instructions
<http://www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki/GettingaWebGL_Implementation>

You have a browser that is able to run webGL try the realtime version
