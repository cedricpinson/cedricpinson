I have put online <http://showwebgl.com> it's a website for artists and
developers who want to show and share their models. The workflow is
really simple you have a model you want to show to people. Upload it and
get the url of the model, then share the url or embed the model in an
iframe.  
The current website is still in progress so consider it in beta, in a
few weeks It will have a nice skin and better feature, but you can still
try it and report to bug to me :)

The list of file format showwebgl is able to read the following file
extension obj, ive, 3ds, dae, ply, osg2, osgb, osgt, osgx, osgs, gem,
geo, mdl, rgb, lws, dxf, tgz, osgterrain, shp, zae, stl, sta, bvh, ac,
flt, ogr, osga, md2, x, json, txp, dw, osgtgz, 3dc, asc, lw, lwo, gdal,
bsp, osg

You can add texture putting everything inside a zip archive, for example
you can put your collada model and its texture inside a zip then upload
the zip file.

The back end use OpenSceneGraph :)
