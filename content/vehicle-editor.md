Since I experimented webgl stuff, some clients start to think seriously
to make 3d apps on the web. For one of them I have done a Vehicle
Editor. The idea is to select a chassis and customize it with different
element you can plug on it.
The pipeline use blender file exported to OpenScenGraph format and then
it convert it to osg.js . If you have a modern browser with
[WebGL](http://khronos.org/webgl/wiki/Getting_a_WebGL_Implementation),
have a try with [real time version](demo/veditor/) or try
the video on [youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMAqplEhnOA)
