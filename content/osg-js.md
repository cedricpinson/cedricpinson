Since I play with WebGL, I wanted a way to work as I do with
[OpenSceneGraph](http://openscenegraph.org). So I started to write a
subset of [OpenSceneGraph](http://openscenegraph.org) in javascript that
uses same concept. For this I have done a plugin for
[OpenSceneGraph](http://openscenegraph.org) that is able to export scene
graph to osgjs json format. [osgjs.org](http://osgjs.org) is young but
still ready to be used for project, I have created
[osgjs.org](http://osgjs.org) to centralize information related to it.
The project needs users and contributors, so want to help ? Go to
[osgjs.org](http://osgjs.org) and try it.
